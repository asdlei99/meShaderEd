meShaderEd changes log

version 0.3.4 (3 Oct 2015)
	- the code is compatible with PyQt5 and PySide
	- NodeEditorPanel renamed to NodeEditorDialog. Source code collected to gui/nodeEditor.
		-- added tabs for "Event Code", "Param Code", "Node", "Param", "Link Info"
		-- added "Event Handlers" list
	- ExportShaderPanel renamed to ExportShaderDialog. Source code collected to gui/exportShader.
		-- it allows to rename/edit shader parameters
		-- export computed code to .sl file
	- MainWindow:
		-- Action "Command->View Computed Code" displays RSL or RIB code for selected node
		-- Action "File->Save Selected As" saves nodenet or single node from selection.
	- RSL and RIB code includes comment block header for each node 
	
version 0.3.3 (15 Oct 2013)
	- Shader parameters names exported as (NodeLabel)_(ParamLabel)
	- parameters names with provider == 'primitive' exported as (ParamLabel)
	- Parameters labels in NodeParamView can change provider, detail and enabled status by CTRL+RMB, ALT+LMB and ALT+RMB
	- For ControlParam, tag <control_code> changed to <code> (though <control_code> will work temporary)
	- For all nodes, tag <param_code> changed to <control_code> (though <param_code> will work temporary)
	- Service nodes (note, swatch, ...) moved to Node Library->utilites folder
	- Added ${NODENETNAME} to node_global_vars.py
	- Added ${OUTPUTNAME} to node_global_vars.py ( ${OUTPUTNAME} = ${TempPath}/${NODENETNAME}_${NODELABEL} )
	- Generated .rib files and output images names now started with "NodenetName_" prefix  
	- ImageViewer doesn't rerender images while switching between tabs 
	- Nodes have new tag <event_code> with event handlers ( ParamLabelRenamed, ParamAdded, ParamRemoved ) 
	- New ImageViewer node uses <event_code> handlers for dynamicaly adding, removing and renaming new image inputs

version 0.3.2 (16 Jul 2013)
	- "Fit All", "Fit Selected" actions implemented.
	- CTRL+LMB on node parameter changes attribute "shaderParam" (white color for "shaderParam == True")
	- CTRL+RMB toggles parameter provider "primitive"/"internal" (orange color for "primitive")
	- ALT+LMB toggles parameter detail "uniform/varying" (italic for "varying") 
	- Added ToolButton for show/hide connected parameter in NodeParamView
	- NodeParamView has tabs for "Input", "Output" parameters
	- NodeParamView header control for resizing labels column
	- Parameters label can be edited by LMB+DblClick

version 0.3.1 (10 Jun 2013)
	- ControlParam with special <control_code> section in XML, that allows to execute
		python code for dynamic parameters manipulation 
	- ShaderInfo class for parsing compiled shaders parameters
	- Lib/RIB/shaders/ReadShader.xml node that uses ShaderInfo call inside <control_code> section
		for reloading shader parameters
	- NodeParam new attributes : enabled, spaceDef, arraySize, defaultArray, valueArray 
		(though arrays parameters support is not fully implemented yet...)
		btext (button text for button ControlParam)
		removable (for removing dynamcally added parameters as in read_shader.xml example)
	- Fixed some shading nodes, code, shaders and textures for Air, Aqsis, Pixie and RenderDotC compatibility 
	- Tested on PyQt 4.10.2 that was linked with Qt 5.0.2 libraries.
	- New service nodes in Library

		- duplicate nodes (Cmd+D) (without connections yet)
	Store Recent Networks in File menu
	Store Recent Projects in File menu
	Saving project description file 'meshadered.prj' in project root
	Added new nodes to Library from DRL
	Library folders rearranged a little bit

version 0.2.8 (20 Jan 2013)
	Few texture nodes were added to Library (analogs of some useful Slim nodes),
	and a bunch of very interesting nodes from DRL (aka Lex Darlog)

	 ["rgb", "hsv", "hsl", "xyz", "XYZ", "YIQ"] for color
	 ["current", "shader", "object", "camera", "world", "raster", "NDC", "screen"]
	 for point, vector, normal, matrix
	And very annoying bug with lost links after saving was fixed. (I hope)
