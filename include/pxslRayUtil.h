/*
 * Compute normalized shading normal with appropriate orientation.
 * We ensure that the normal faces forward if Sides is 2 or if the 
 * shader evaluation is caused by a ray hit.
 *
 * So we only adhere to the object's surface orientation if Sides is 1
 * and we're on a REYES micropolygon grid.  Why, you may ask, would a
 * point be shaded if it is facing away and Sides is 1?  Isn't that
 * exactly what Sides 1 should disallow?  The reason is that points
 * on grids that have both forward and backward facing points do get
 * shaded even if Sides is 1.  It's only if the entire micropolygon
 * grid is facing away that it doesn't get shaded.
 *
 * Why do we want to adhere to the surface orientation if Sides is 1?
 * Why not just always flip the normal forward with the faceforward()
 * call?  The reason is that this would mean that some points on some
 * REYES micropolygon grids would have unintended normals.  If we 
 * shade a point with the shading result for the wrong side of the
 * surface, the color can be wrong, giving artifacts along silhouette
 * edges where the color is interpolated between shading point that
 * facing forward and facing backward.  Also, in some cases, the
 * shading computation on the "wrong" side might be much more
 * expensive than on the "right" side.
